## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/home) - multi page support
- [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/) - for multi page animations
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

### What I learned

I learned a lot of new things here, such as creating a multi-page website, adding transitions with react router, more about dynamic styles with TailwindCSS, and a bit more of react.

### Continued development

I would continue focusing on using tailwindCSS along with react, and discovering new libraries/frameworks such as react router and framer motion
